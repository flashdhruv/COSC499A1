# COSC499A1
This is the readme for my assignment.
There are two features.
One is simply a program that finds the square of each digit in a number and adds teh sum.
The second feature reads the implementation of the first feature from 1 to 500 to a CSV file. 
The file consists of the file with both features, this read me and the CSV file.
